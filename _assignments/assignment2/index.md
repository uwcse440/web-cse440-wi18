# Project Description

In this assignment, you will brainstorm a large set of possible tasks and design ideas for your project. 
You will then conduct design research to learn more about your problem and the current practices of people who might use your design.
You will draw upon the ideas developed in your brainstorming and the observations made in your design research
to help develop a set of potential tasks your design might support. 
You will next sketch how a set of initial designs might support those tasks.
You will choose a design to pursue in the remainder of the course and storyboard the details of your design in the context of important tasks.
Finally, you will present your design process in a report.

More specifically, you will do the following:

1. Generate ideas for potential problems, tasks, features, and interactions using a group ideation exercise.

   ([Assignment 2a](#project_ideation))
    
2. Conduct design research (e.g., contextual inquiry, interviews, observations) to learn from at least __three__ people who might use your design.

   ([Assignment 2b](#design_research_plan)), ([Assignment 2c](#design_research_checkin)), ([Assignment 2d](#design_research_review))

3. Develop __six__ tasks that might be performed with your design. 

   Select these to capture the important aspects of the problem you are solving and to provide coverage of the designs 
   you will explore. Create these based on your observations and analyses of existing tasks as well as your vision for 
   new tasks enabled by potential designs. Remember that tasks say what is accomplished, while leaving open how to accomplish it.

   As you progress through your project, you can and should consider revising your tasks. 
   Expect to refine or change your tasks as your understanding of the problem matures or according to feedback you receive.
   The tasks you report in this assignment therefore must be appropriate but are not necessarily final.

   ([Assignment 2e](#task_review)) 

4. Brainstorm and sketch __three__ very different initial designs for your interface. 
   Each design should support __four__ of your tasks.
   
   Do not illustrate the entire design, but instead sketch key aspects needed to illustrate the functionality. 
   These should be rough sketches on paper (i.e., not digital mockups), including illustrations of their relations 
   (e.g., arrows showing transitions and relationships).    
   
   The purpose of these sketches is to explore the design space before you lock yourself into a single design.
   They must demonstrate significant consideration of substantially different approaches to your problem.

   ([Assignment 2f](#design_checkin)) 

5. From your sketches, select __one__ design to pursue for the remainder of the quarter and __two__ tasks that emphasize
   critical functionality of your design. These tasks should be non-trivial, critical to solving your problem, and should 
   emphasize long-lived or repeated activities. In contrast, a one-time login screen for a social networking application 
   is not worth being the focus of your project, does not define your project functionality, and is not sufficiently interesting.

   Storyboard your chosen design for your chosen tasks, illustrating how the tasks are accomplished in your design.

   ([Assignment 2g](#design_review))
    
6. Summarize your design process in a report.

   ([Assignment 2h](#final_report)) <!--, ([Presentation](#presentation)) -->

# Deliverables

<a name="project_ideation"></a>

## 2a: Project Ideation

Due: {{ page.due_project_2a }}

The goal of this assignment is to begin thinking about how to plan effective design research to inform your design process.

Generate 5 to 10 different ideas related to each of the following aspects of your project proposal:
- Forms: types of technology on which a design might be developed (e.g., desktop, phone/tablet, sensor, watch, wearable).
- Interactions: types of social situations that a design might engage or support.
- Features: a specific capability a design might have.
- Tasks: what a person might accomplish with a design. 

Divide a large sheet of paper into 32 squares (or take two sheets of paper with 16 squares on each), each approximately 2in by 2in. Sketch your ideas, one in each square. Each idea should be either a quick doodle with a caption or a one-sentence idea. A person familiar with your project but not in your group should be able to understand the idea each sketch conveys.

The goal is to begin exploring the space of possibilities, not attempting to polish some particular possibility. Focus on the quantity of ideas, not the quality of any one idea. You may include ideas from existing products. No two ideas should be alike. When you get stuck, find a context to inspire new ideas.

Given a space of possible directions, your project needs to begin to gather information on how to generate and consider ideas. While brainstorming design ideas consider the following in your design:
People: the user group you have decided to focus on. Also include other types of people you might work with.
Foci: potential foci you might apply in your learning.

### Submission

For the submission, capture and submit a legible image of your brainstorm. 

Submit via Canvas here:

{% if page.link_project_2a != nil %}<{{ page.link_project_2a }}>{% else %}`Link to be added`{% endif %}


### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __1 points__ based on the ideas generated.

<a name="design_research_plan"></a>

## 2b: Design Research Plan

Due: {{ page.due_project_2b }}

In one paragraph, describe the people who might use your design and other stakeholders for your design. Describe the particular design research methods and participants you plan to pursue, including such details as their background and the environment where you will observe their current practices. Give enough information to convince us that you can actually find and engage with your target participants in the next week.

Be precise! For example, your target participants should not be “doctors” but instead a specific group of doctors (e.g., Family Practitioners in the UW Roosevelt Clinic). If gaining access to the target participants is non-trivial (e.g., as with busy doctors), describe the steps you have already taken to gain access and your plans to recover if you are unable to gain access. Indicate when you will be conducting your design research, being as specific as possible.

In another paragraph, describe the ideal design research you would conduct. For this, list at least 3 research methods that would help you to engage with and learn from these people. 

In the final paragraph, describe which research method you will focus on for the purpose of this class (usually this will be one of the research methods listed in the second paragraph, but in some cases, you might decide that a fourth research method is more realistic). Describe why you chose this method for your user research plan.


### Samples from Prior Offerings

Samples from prior offerings include:

{% for currentoffering in site.data.samples.offering %}{% for currentsample in site.data.samples[currentoffering.key] %}
  -  {{ currentoffering.name }} - [{{ currentsample.name }}]({{ currentsample.link }}): [2b_{{ currentsample.suffix }}.pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/samples/2b/2b_{{ currentsample.suffix }}.pdf){% endfor %}{% endfor %}

Note that details of assignments may have changed since prior offerings, so their reports may not map to the current project.
Also note these samples are intended to illustrate a variety of approaches, none of which is intended to be ideal or exemplary.
Be sure to understand and carefully consider project requirements and feedback from the course staff in the context of your own work.

<a name="design_research_checkin"></a>

## 2c: Design Research Check-In

Due: {{ page.due_project_2c }}

Complete design research with at least one participant prior to this check-in.
You hopefully learned something about the needs of people who might use your design,
but also about effectively conducting your design research.

Describe your first design research participant and your findings:

- Who you observed or interviewed, their background, and the environment.
- What did you learn? 
- What tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover? 
- Did you encounter any difficulties establishing rapport or getting the information you need?

Discuss what remains to be pursued in your additional design research.
We fully expect changes will be necessary, as design research
can be difficult to get right and often important topics are left unresolved. 

- What are your plans for the remaining participants?
- How do you plan to change your design research plan based on what you learned with your first participant?

### Samples from Prior Offerings

Samples from prior offerings include:

{% for currentoffering in site.data.samples.offering %}{% for currentsample in site.data.samples[currentoffering.key] %}
  -  {{ currentoffering.name }} - [{{ currentsample.name }}]({{ currentsample.link }}): [2c_{{ currentsample.suffix }}.pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/samples/2c/2c_{{ currentsample.suffix }}.pdf){% endfor %}{% endfor %}

Note that details of assignments may have changed since prior offerings, so their reports may not map to the current project.

### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format. Submit via Canvas here:

{% if page.link_project_2c != nil %}<{{ page.link_project_2c }}>{% else %}`Link to be added`{% endif %}

Names of participants should be replaced with pseudonyms in all documents.
It is important to protect participant anonymity, even in the case that reporting seems harmless.

In class and section, be prepared to discuss your design research with other teams and the course staff.

### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __2 points__:

1. __Information from First Participant__: (1 points)
2. __Plan for Remaining Participants__: (1 points)

<a name="design_research_review"></a>

## 2d: Design Research Review

Due: {{ page.due_project_2d }}

#### Themes

Complete design research with at least three participants. Discuss your process and what you learned:

- Who you observed or interviewed, their background, and the environment.
- Note anything unique about each participant and comment on the rationale behind these observations.

Across your participants, we expect some emergence of common themes, problems, and practices.

- Identify high-level themes and problems the participants share in their practices.
- Do these themes, problems, and practices suggest tasks to important to design for?

If you are having trouble identifying high-level themes, problems, and practices,
it may indicate a need to develop additional understanding through more design research.
Because your findings at this point are critical to setting a foundation for your project,
ensure your design research has provided you the insights and perspective you need to proceed.

#### Task Analysis Questions

Informed by your design research, provide brief answers to the following questions.
These should help you begin to identify tasks essential to your design.

1. Who is going to use the design? 
2. What tasks do they now perform?
3. What tasks are desired?
4. How are the tasks learned?
5. Where are the tasks performed?
6. What is the relationship between the person and data?
7. What other tools does the person have?
8. How do people communicate with each other?
9. How often are the tasks performed?
10. What are the time constraints on the tasks?
11. What happens when things go wrong?

<a name="task_review"></a>

## 2e: Task Review

Due: {{ page.due_project_2e }}

Building on what you learned in your design research, design six tasks that you believe are integral to your overall design goal:

 - You should include existing tasks (i.e., tasks people already do) and new tasks (i.e., tasks that will be enabled by your design). 
 - These should be real world tasks that have details (e.g., instead of "programming a DVR", details like "programming a DVR to record the Simpsons on Sundays"). 
 - These tasks should not have any specific relation to the exact design sketches you will brainstorm next. 
 - Your six tasks should span a wide range of functionality and difficulty, from easy to hard tasks.

Each task should be described in text. Tasks say what is accomplished, leaving open how to accomplish it.
So be sure that your task conveys a problem and what is accomplished, rather than a step-by-step walkthrough of scenario with a particular design.

### Samples from Prior Offerings

Samples from prior offerings include:

{% for currentoffering in site.data.samples.offering %}{% for currentsample in site.data.samples[currentoffering.key] %}
  -  {{ currentoffering.name }} - [{{ currentsample.name }}]({{ currentsample.link }}): [2e_{{ currentsample.suffix }}.pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/samples/2e/2e_{{ currentsample.suffix }}.pdf){% endfor %}{% endfor %}

Note that details of assignments may have changed since prior offerings, so their reports may not map to the current project.
Also note these samples are intended to illustrate a variety of approaches, none of which is intended to be ideal or exemplary.
Be sure to understand and carefully consider project requirements and feedback from the course staff in the context of your own work.

### Submission

No more than two pages of text in PDF format: 

 - six task descriptions (one paragraph each)

Submit via Canvas here:

1. __Each of 6 Tasks__: (.33 point)

<a name="design_checkin"></a>

## 2f: Design Check-In ("3x4")

Due: {{ page.due_project_2f }}

You have identified and described six important tasks for your design problem. 
You will now brainstorm and sketch three very different initial designs for your interface:
 
 - Each design should support four of your tasks, but they do not necessarily need to all support the same four tasks.
 - Sketch key aspects needed to illustrate the functionality in your four tasks. A design may imply additional tasks, but do not illustrate the entire design. 
 - These should be rough sketches on paper (i.e., not digital mockups), including illustrations of their relations (e.g., arrows showing transitions and relationships).

The purpose of these sketches is to explore the design space before you lock yourself into a single design.
They must demonstrate significant consideration of substantially different approaches to your problem.

### Samples from Prior Offerings

Samples from prior offerings include:

{% for currentoffering in site.data.samples.offering %}{% for currentsample in site.data.samples[currentoffering.key] %}

Note that details of assignments may have changed since prior offerings, so their reports may not map to the current project.
Also note these samples are intended to illustrate a variety of approaches, none of which is intended to be ideal or exemplary.
Be sure to understand and carefully consider project requirements and feedback from the course staff in the context of your own work.

### Submission

No more than three pages of text in PDF format:

 - six task descriptions (one paragraph each, updated as needed from prior assignment)
 - for each of three initial designs
   - the high-level idea of the design (one paragraph)
   - scanned images of the design (sketches, not digital mockups)
   - how to complete each the four sketched tasks (e.g., a list of steps, one or two sentences per task)

Images do not count against your page limit, and are therefore effectively free. 
You should embed images throughout your PDF, keeping them near the text that references them.
The limit applies to the approximate amount of text you would have if all images were removed.

<a name="design_review"></a>

## 2g: Design Review ("1x2")

Due: {{ page.due_project_2g }}

From your design sketches, select one design that you will refine in the remainder of this course. 
Then select two tasks that will be the focus of your design refinement. 
The selected tasks need to be representative of the experience of using your design. 

Prepare one paragraph describing why you selected the design you did. 
Draw upon feedback from critiques and data from your design research.

 - Why this design and these tasks? 
 - What makes the design better suited to the people for whom you are targeting your design? 
 - Why are these tasks more compelling than the others? 

Convey a strong understanding of which design you chose, which tasks you chose, and why you chose them.

Then create a storyboard of each task for your selected design.
These should be done on paper, then scanned (i.e., do not create or recreate them in a drawing package).
They should clearly indicate the functionality of the design and what the interface will be like,
conveying the major aspects of the design in enough detail that a person not in your group can understand 
how the design supports each task. 
As needed, add descriptions that explicitly reference the storyboard, add more sketches, or annotate them in multiple colors.

### Samples from Prior Offerings

Samples from prior offerings include:

{% for currentoffering in site.data.samples.offering %}{% for currentsample in site.data.samples[currentoffering.key] %}

Note that details of assignments may have changed since prior offerings, so their reports may not map to the current project.
Also note these samples are intended to illustrate a variety of approaches, none of which is intended to be ideal or exemplary.
Be sure to understand and carefully consider project requirements and feedback from the course staff in the context of your own work.

### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format:

 - discussion of your design and task choices (one paragraph)
 - scanned images of your storyboards and associated descriptions 

Images do not count against your page limit, and are therefore effectively free. 
You should embed images throughout your PDF, keeping them near the text that references them.
The limit applies to the approximate amount of text you would have if all images were removed.

Submit via Canvas here:

2. __Each of 2 Storyboards__: (1 points)

<a name="final_report">

## 2h: Final Report

Due: {{ page.due_project_2h }}

Prepare a report documenting your process of getting the right design.
Your report should follow the outline below, and will be graded using the guidelines that follow.
The provided page allocations are estimates, intended to help convey how to divide up the space.

If you completed all of your milestones above, you will have much of the content for this report.
But it is critical that you revise and update that content.
You have received extensive feedback throughout your design process, and evaluation of your report will 
include how you have addressed and incorporated that feedback to improve relative to your prior milestones.

1. __Title__ 

   A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.

2. __Each Team Member’s Name and Role(s)__

3. __Problem and Solution Overview__: (1 paragraph)

   A concise statement of the problem you are tackling and a brief synopsis of your proposed solution.

4. __Design Research Goals, Stakeholders, and Participants__: (1 page)

   Describe your design research, including the participants, their background, and their environment.
    
   Describe why you chose the particular methods and participants in your design research.

5. __Design Research Results and Themes__: (1 page)

   Discuss common themes, problems, and practices that emerged in your design research.
   
   Include any updated themes that emerged when considering your design research in your design process.

6. __Answers to Task Analysis Questions__: (2 pages)

   Provide brief answers to the task analysis questions.
   
   These should be updated according to your evolved understanding of the problem and your design.

7. __Proposed Design Sketches - "3x4"__: (1 page)

   Present scanned images of your three initial designs in the context of their four tasks.
   
   Include one paragraph for each design, discussing how it supports your tasks.
   
   Include one paragraph discussing your choice of design and tasks to further pursue.

8. __Written Scenarios - "1x2"__: (1 page)

   Convert your two tasks into written scenarios for your design.
   Scenarios include the steps a person will go through to accomplish the task, including references to your design.

   Scenarios do not need to detail every little step, but should be realistic, should be dependent upon the design 
   you have chosen, should appropriately reference elements of your design, and should communicate how a person
   will accomplish the task using your design.

9. __Storyboards of the Selected Design__

   Include updated storyboards of your design. Reference these appropriately in your scenarios.

Ensure your report is appropriately clear and easy to read. This includes:

 - text should be clear and concise
 - use section headings as appropriate
 - include images in the body of the write-up with appropriate figure numbers and captions
 - refer to the figures in the body of your text
 - check for typos, spelling, and grammar errors

### Submission

No more than eight pages of text in PDF format, following the above outline.

Images do not count against your page limit, and are therefore effectively free. 
You should embed images throughout your PDF, keeping them near the text that references them.
The limit applies to the approximate amount of text you would have if all images were removed.

Submit via Canvas here: 

{% if page.link_project_2h != nil %}<{{ page.link_project_2h }}>{% else %}`Link to be added`{% endif %}

Names of participants should be replaced with pseudonyms in all documents.
It is important to protect participant anonymity, even in the case that reporting seems harmless.
