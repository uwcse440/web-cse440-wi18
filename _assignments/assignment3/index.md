# Project Description 

In this assignment, you will iteratively improve your design.
You will construct a paper prototype informed by your earlier work.
You will then use inspection to identify and correct issues in the paper prototype.
You will next conduct a series of three usability tests, further identifying and correcting issues in your paper prototype.
You will create a digital mockup that captures the result of your design process.
Finally, you will present your design process in a report and presentation.

1. Develop a paper prototype for your design. It should convey all critical aspects
   of your design, including support for testing your two primary tasks.

   This prototype has been informed by your prior sketching and storyboarding.
   But it also contains more details than your prior exploratory designs.
   If necessary or appropriate, revise your tasks or scenarios based on what your learn in prototyping.

   ([Assignment 3a](#paper_prototype))
   
2. Conduct a heuristic evaluation of your paper prototype.
   You will perform an evaluation in class, and will supplement this with another evaluation.
	
   Revise your paper prototype based on what you learn in heuristic evaluation.
   Your tasks and scenarios are likely stable, but revise them if your evaluation reveals a need.

   ([Assignment 3b](#heuristic_evaluation))

3. Conduct usability tests with _three_ participants, each completing your _two_ primary tasks.

   Make a log of critical incidents during the test, including both positive and negative events. 
   For example, a person might make a mistake or might comment on something they like. 
   Write it down along with a description of the context of the incident. 
   Later you will discuss and prioritize these events, assigning a severity rating to problems
   (ranging from 0 for _no problem_ to 4 for _usability catastrophe_). 
   
   You should not use friends, members of the class, or people you know to have engineering backgrounds. 
   You also should not use people who have been previously exposed to your project. 
   Target an appropriate set of participants based on your design research and resulting design.

   Be sure to divide your team into roles when conducting the usability test.
   There is simply too much for a single person to conduct a test. 
   As discussed in class, these roles include the facilitator, the computer, and one or more observers.

   As part of your introduction, have your facilitator show the participant how to interact with your design. 
   Do not show participants how to perform your tasks that you will later test.
   Instead show them how paper prototyping works, how your system generally works, 
   and give an example of something specific that is sufficiently different from your tasks.
   
   Consider recording your tests to allow you to see exactly what happened.
   If you do this, ensure your recording preserves the anonymity of the participant.
   Frame your shot such that you capture interaction with the prototype without unnecessarily capturing the participant.
   
   Each participant should perform both tasks. 
   Keep the data separate for each participant and each task. 
   Keep participant names confidential, and preserve anonymity in your reporting. 
   Remember participation must be voluntary, participants should be free to stop at any time,
   and you should emphasize that your focus is on identifying usability issues in the design.

   Revise your paper prototype based on what you learn in usability testing.
   This can and should include fixing major issues as soon as they are detected, before additional tests.
   Your tasks and scenarios are likely stable, but revise them if your evaluation reveals a need.

   ([Assignment 3d](#usability_testing_checkin)), ([Assignment 3e](#usability_testing_review))

4. After refining your paper prototype based on your usability testing, construct a digital mockup of your design.

   Do not begin working in digital prototyping until you finish revising your paper prototype.
   It is much easier to iterate on your design in the paper prototyping phase.
   As you transition into digital prototyping, you will consider other aspects of the design.
   These details you may not have considered (e.g., visual design, layout, color, typography),
   but can also include constraints or mismatches introduced by the technology itself.

   We have no strong preference to what digital tools you utilize to create your mockup. 
   But it must be digital (e.g., you may not use pictures of a hand-drawn sketch).
   
   Some recommendations from the course staff include:

   - [Adobe Experience Design](http://www.adobe.com/products/experience-design.html)
   - [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)
   - [Axure](http://www.axure.com/)
   - [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
   - [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
   - [Indigo Studio](http://www.infragistics.com/products/indigo-studio)
   - [InkScape](http://www.inkscape.org/en/)
   - [Microsoft Visio](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio/)
   - [Omnigraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle)
   - [Vectr](https://vectr.com/)

   You will use this digital mockup to effectively communicate your design in your final report, website, and poster.
   Some tools support creation of interactive mockups (e.g., allow clicking active regions to move between screens).
   This would add additional capabilities to your website, and you are welcome to use such a tool.
   But interactive mockups are neither expected nor required.
   
   Implement your digital mockup to include key frames that illustrate your design.
   It should convey all critical aspects of your design, including walkthroughs for your two primary tasks.

   ([Assignment 3e](#digital_mockup))

5. Summarize your design process in a report and presentation.

   ([Assignment 3f](#final_report)), ([Presentation](#presentation))

# Deliverables 

<a name="paper_prototype"></a>

## 3a: Paper Prototype 

Due: {{ page.due_project_3a }}.

The goal of this milestone is to develop an initial paper prototype that will begin to allow testing of your design.

Develop a paper prototype that conveys the critical aspects of your design, including support for testing your two primary tasks.

### Samples from Prior Offerings

Samples from prior offerings include:

{% for currentoffering in site.data.samples.offering %}{% for currentsample in site.data.samples[currentoffering.key] %}
  -  {{ currentoffering.name }} - [{{ currentsample.name }}]({{ currentsample.link }}): [3a_{{ currentsample.suffix }}.pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/samples/3a/3a_{{ currentsample.suffix }}.pdf){% endfor %}{% endfor %}

Note that details of assignments may have changed since prior offerings, so their reports may not map to the current project.
Also note these samples are intended to illustrate a variety of approaches, none of which is intended to be ideal or exemplary.
Be sure to understand and carefully consider project requirements and feedback from the course staff in the context of your own work.

### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format.

Capture and submit detailed images of your paper prototype. Include:

- An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.
- Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.

Images do not count against your page limit, and are therefore effectively free.
You should embed images throughout your PDF, keeping them near the text that references them.
The limit applies to the approximate amount of text you would have if all images were removed.

Submit via Canvas here: 

{% if page.link_project_3a != nil %}<{{ page.link_project_3a }}>{% else %}`Link to be added`{% endif %}

Bring your prototype to class. You will need it to conduct Heuristic Evaluation.

### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __9 points__:

1. __Overall Completeness and Appropriateness of Paper Prototype__: (3 points)
2. __Completeness, Appropriateness, and Documentation of Each Task__: (3 points per task)

<a name="heuristic_evaluation"></a>

## 3b: Heuristic Evaluations 

Due: {{ page.due_project_3b }}.

The goal of this milestone is to obtain a heuristic evaluation of your paper prototype.

This assignment will begin in class. You will be delayed in completing this if you do not bring your prototype to class.

In class, pair with another team to conduct heuristic evaluations.
One team will conduct a heuristic evaluation of the other’s paper prototype, the two teams will then reverse roles.
Each team will therefore conduct and receive one heuristic evaluation.

Outside of class, arrange to receive a second heuristic evaluation with another team.

We will provide a worksheet with Nielsen's heuristics:

[3b-nielsen-heuristics.pdf]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/assignment3/3b-nielsen-heuristics.pdf)

Evaluators will use index cards to record issues identified in evaluation. 
Include what heuristic is violated, and a severity rating (ranging from 0 for _no problem_ to 4 for _usability catastrophe_).

Revise your paper prototype based on what you learn in heuristic evaluation.
Your tasks and scenarios are likely stable, but revise them if your evaluation reveals a need.

### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format.

Capture and submit detailed images of your heuristic evaluation work. Include:

- Who conducted each evaluation
  (i.e., which members of your team facilitated the evaluation, which classmates conducted the evaluation).
- An overview image of your paper prototype and notes.

The evaluated project will keep the created index cards, so they can use them to improve their design.
The evaluated project should be careful not to lose these, as their contents will be submitted in the next assignment.
Similarly, be careful to keep a detailed record of any changes that are made, as these will be submitted in the next assignment.

Submit via Canvas here:

{% if page.link_project_3b != nil %}<{{ page.link_project_3b }}>{% else %}`Link to be added`{% endif %}

### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __6 points__:

1. __Participation of Each Half-Team__: (3 points per half-team)

<a name="usability_testing_checkin"></a>

## 3c: Usability Testing Check-In

Due: {{ page.due_project_3c }}.

The goal of this milestone is to document changes resulting from your inspection-based analyses
and to begin usability testing of your revised prototype with participants.

You received two heuristic evaluations of your paper prototype. 
If desired, you may also conduct a heuristic evaluation or cognitive walkthrough for your own paper prototype.
Also complete one usability test with your paper prototype.

Present your iterative revisions and your plan going forward:

- Present a table or list of results from your inspection-based methods. For each identified issue, include:
  - An image of the relevant portion of the prototype.
  - The identified issue, including the heuristic that is violated or the believability issue identified in walkthrough. 
  - The severity of the issue assigned by the team.
  - An image and explanation of any revision implemented as a result.

- Discuss your first usability test. Provide a description of the test, including the participant, the environment, 
  why you chose this participant and environment, the test protocol, and the roles of each team member who participated in the test. 
  Discuss anything you learned about the testing process itself, or any revisions you decided you need to make to your testing process.

- Present a table or list of results from your first usability test. For each critical incident, include:
  - An image of the relevant portion of the prototype.
  - Description of the incident, remembering that these can be either positive or negative. 
  - For negative incidents, the severity of the issue assigned by the team.
  - For negative incidents, an image and explanation of any revision implemented as a result.

- Submit detailed images of your current paper prototype, as revised in this process. Include both:
  - An overview image that shows your entire paper prototype.
  - Detailed images showing each component as you walk through your two primary tasks.

- Present your plan for the remainder of your usability tests. Describe who you will target for participation, what
  goals you have for the additional tests, planned roles for each team member, and any new approaches you will employ.

    Convey the critical aspects of your design, including your two primary tasks.
    Briefly discuss any changes you needed to make as you switched to your digital tools instead of paper. 
    Briefly discuss any changes you made in response to critique.
    Include descriptions of how your design supports each of your primary tasks (e.g., one paragraph per task).

9.  __Discussion__: (1 page)

    Reflect upon and discuss your project and your results. For example: 
   
    - What did you learn from the process of iterative design? 
    - How did the process shape your final design? 
    - How have your tasks changed as a result of your usability tests?
    - Do you think you could have used more, or fewer, iterations upon your design?

<a name="presentation"></a>

## 3g: Presentation

Due: {{ page.due_project_3g }}.

Prepare a presentation of your process in getting the design right. It should encompass all of your work in Assignment 3.

- Two members of your team should deliver the presentation, each speaking to relatively equal portions.
- An seven minute time limit will be strictly enforced, with additional time for questions.
- Your presenters should be different from your presenters in Assignment 2, such that everybody has presented at least once this quarter.
  If there is some reason this cannot work for your team, be sure you have communicated with us.

A suggested organization of this presentation is:

1. __Title__:
 
   A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea. Include team member names and roles.
 
2. __Overall Problem__: 

   Tell this as a story, instead of simply reading the slide. Motivate your audience to be interested in your problem.

3. __Initial Paper Prototype__:
 
   Present your initial paper prototype.
   Convey the critical aspects of your design, including your two primary tasks.
 
4. __Testing Process and Results__:
 
   Describe your testing process, what you learned from it, and how you refined your prototype as a result.
 
5. __Final Paper Prototype__:

   Present your final paper prototype.
   Convey the critical aspects of your design, including your two primary tasks.
   This might be shorter than your presentation of the initial paper prototype, 
   because you already presented changes and are about to present the digital mockup.
   Keep your presentation appropriately paced instead of getting bogged down here.

6. __Digital Mockup__:
 
   Present your digital mockup.
   Convey the critical aspects of your design, including your two primary tasks.
 
7. __Summary__:

   Summarize the lessons learned in your design process.

We strongly recommend rehearsing your presentation beforehand. 
For example, arrange to practice together with another group or two, giving each other feedback on your presentations.

Note that we have not provided recommendations for the number of slides in each section of this presentation. 
You can deliver your presentation using as many or as few slides as you want, 
as long as you successfully address the above points and the presentation falls within the time restriction.

Your presentation may be in PPT, PPTX, or PDF format. 

To minimize switching time, we will have all presentations on a single laptop running Microsoft Windows.
You should optimize your presentation for portability (e.g., ensure any necessary fonts are embedded).
If we detect any obvious formatting issues on the presentation machine, we may fix them or contact you to fix them.
But you are ultimately responsible for your presentation.
